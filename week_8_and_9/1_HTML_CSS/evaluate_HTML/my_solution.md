## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.
<!-- Pros: It has a seperate CSS page. It also has a section just for javascript. Cons: The page is almost impossible to read without breaking up the code. Doesn't start with explaining what version of HTML they are using. The Javascript should be at the end of the page. -->
 
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly?
 <!--They seemed to use it fairly losely, but it worked. -->

Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.
 <!-- Yes it seems okay. No H tags so not good for SEO. -->
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.
<!-- It looks like they broke up the HTML from the CSS most of the time. They did put some style stuff in the HTML page, ie. <td style="text-align:right;padding-right:4px;"> which isn't great, but of the color details and other style details were done in CSS.-->
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?
<!-- The javascript I wasn't totally clear about. -->
 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?
<!-- It is DRY. They broke up the body, the links, voting arrows. It breaks everything up very neatly. -->
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?
<!-- No. It was basic HTML code not HTML5 -->
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?
<!-- It works, but definitely not an example of the most strict standards. Hard to follow and understand and mixing style elements with HTML -->
